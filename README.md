## ðŸ”Ž Overview

**FLRToolkit** is a Shiny-based application suite that provides essential tools for **Forensic Likelihood-Ratio (LR)-based** and **Biometric** systems. It focuses on **source-level interpretation**, offering functionalities for **LR computation, calibration, and validation**.

The toolkit provides an end-to-end workflow for forensic LR evaluation, including:

-   **LR Computation** - computation of LR scores by different methods.

-   **Calibration** â€“ fusion and calibration of LR scores from multiple systems.

    1.  Linear Logistic-Regression Calibrator
    2.  Bi-Gaussianized Calibrator

-   **Validation** â€“ performance visualization of a single LR system.

    1.  Tippett Plot Generator
    2.  Empirical Cross-Entropy Plot Generator
